# This is a configuration file for the MOC player.  It should be named
# 'config' and placed in the ~/.moc directory.  As this file can specify
# commands which invoke other applications, MOC will refuse to start if it
# is not owned by either root or the current user, or if it is writable by
# anyone other than its owner.  All options are given with their default
# values, and therefore commented.
